Project Title : HEV -Battery with Exhaust Environment - Thermal study Role : CAE Engineer Tools : CATIA , ANS A, Fluent Scope : To study battery thermal management for the different types of coolant domain designs. 2. Project title : Hybrid Car Cabin -air-environmen t -Thermal study Role : CA D Engineer Tools : CATIA , ANSA Scope : To build a fluid domain for the given car control model with B attery Compartment and genera te the mesh for the entire domain 3. Project title : Simulation of Cavitation on Hydrofoil Role : CFD Engineer Tools : ANSA, T -Grid, Fluent Scope : Cavitation on hydrofoils causing erosi on over the surface due to separation . This project is intended to reduce the cavitation bubble. 4. Project Title : Simulation of Flow and H eat transfer in the CTP container Role : CFD Engineer -trainee, Tools : ANSA, T -Grid, Fluent Scope : CTP container consists o f electronic panels. W e need to reduce the temperature of the panels which emits he at by passing th e cold air via A/C duct. 5. Project title : External Aerodynamics study over a car Role : CFD Engineer Tools : ANSA, T -Grid, Fluent Scope : To carry out external flow over a car to find Co -efficient of drag (CD), Flow behavior and pressure distribution on and around the vehicle. 6. Project title : Die design of Batter y components for blow moulding Role : CAD Engineer Tools : CATIA V5, ANSA Scope : Model the die design as per the client requirement ACADEMIC PROJECT Title : Power Generation by using Blade -tip Magnetization of Jet Engine Description: This project wa s dealing with the generation of electric current using m agnetic material at the tip of compressor blades and fan bl ades, coil in the engine cowling and walls of compressor . By this project the size of engine can be get reduced. T he generator weight will be reduced in turn inc rease the efficiency of flight. This reduction in size will reduce the drag produced by profile of engine. Obtained power wa s quite equals to present generator assembly .
