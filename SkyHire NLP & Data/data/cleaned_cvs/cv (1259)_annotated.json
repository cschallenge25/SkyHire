Collaborating with a team of electrical engineers, I have worked on wiring design project s for the raceway cabin , onboard networking systems, and lower lob es of various 7 -series airplanes. In addition, I have also worked as an Engineer Assistant at LKK Manufacturing, where I had the chance to learn about working with suppliers, logistics, and mechanics to put together efficient production schedules that meet sales and business needs. I would like to be a candidate for the Manufacturing Line Manager and 3D modeling positions , as my experience in 3D modeling and managing the daily tasks of running a manufacturing plant is highly applicable for the position. Alternatively, I would like to be on the systems team. Given the chance, I would like to work on the Prusa i3 dual extrusion head or the bio -printer projects. I look forward to hearing from you about the opportunity to join the EE 400D Robot Company.
